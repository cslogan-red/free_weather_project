This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Overview

Free Weather Project (FWP) builds on the base concepts established in [weather_react](https://github.com/cslogan-red/weather_react) and [weather_react_redux](https://github.com/cslogan-red/weather_react_redux) but creates an app with (simplified) patterns that are much closer to what you'd see in real, production apps.

Check out the live version at: [Free Weather Project](https://freeweatherproject.net/)

From the CSS, to the type ahead search, to the serverless back end, I've built the FWP completely from scratch and it's meant to showcase a number of design patterns that are resuable across any React app as you're getting started.

It utilizes the [DarkSky API](https://darksky.net/poweredby/), along with the Google Geocoding API (each obfuscated via the API layer) for weather results based on any entered location, along
with geotracking for weather in your current location, if allowed.
